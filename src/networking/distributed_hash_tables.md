# Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs)

A Distributed Hash Table (DHT) is an example of a structured overlay network.
They are a distributed system that enables the same lookup features as a Hash Table, mapping keys to values.

These systems usually are used to store content over the network, so, they are also used as a content routing system, for data discovery and retrieval in the network.

Ziku network does not use any DHT protocol, since it does not intend to store content over the network (all the future storage needs will be delegated to IPFS).
